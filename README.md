# 🌍 Countries API Project

This project demonstrates how to interact with a public REST API to retrieve, process, and explore country-level data using Python.

## 📌 Description

Using the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/), this notebook performs the following:

- Sends HTTP requests to retrieve country data (name, capital, population, region, etc.)
- Parses and transforms JSON responses using Python and `requests`
- Handles API errors and missing data gracefully
- Filters and organizes the output for readability
- Explores specific cases (e.g., countries by population or region)

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- `requests`
- `json`
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Structure

- `Countries API.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the API interaction and data processing steps

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the notebook with Jupyter or JupyterLab
3. Run the cells to fetch and display data from the API
